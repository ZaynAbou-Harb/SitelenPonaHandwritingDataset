# Sitelen Pona Handwritting Dataset

This is a public handwriting dataset for 40 Sitelen Pona symbols, collected for a WSU CptS 580 Class Project. More symbols may be added over time.

There has been some basic cleaning of the data to filter out obviously bad samples, but they are otherwise the raw samples as collected, and may contain messy, or otherwise incorrect data. Data is sorted by class, then by if the symbol was shown to the user submitting the sample. The symbol hidden dataset is much more diverse, both for better and for worse. The classes are NOT balanced at all, and 20 of the symbols have much more samples.
